    <h2>Why I choose BSIT?
    <br>
    <br>
    </h2>
<p>I choose BSIT course because I have interest in coding and web development.<br>
I want to understand what happens behind the screen, and I want to learn these things<br>
not just for myself, but also to create solutions that can make people's lives easier and<br>
help other people.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Technology is already everywhere in today's world, and I believe studying BSIT will<br>
allow me to grow with it. This course also gives me the chance to show my creativity<br>
in both design and problem solving.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Most importantly, I know this couse will open many opportunities for me to find work<br>
in the future. With that, I'll be able to support my family and give back to them while<br>
pursuing something I truly enjoy.</p>
